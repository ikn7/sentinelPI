The summary covers building SentinelPi (multi-source monitoring station for Raspberry Pi) through multiple phases with various UI improvements.\n\n2. **Previous session summary covers**:\n   - Sources syncing to DB\n   - HTML stripping in articles\n   - Compact article layout\n   - Sources as table with inline actions\n   - Default active sources (Le Monde + Portail IE)\n   - Add source form position\n   - Filters page optimization\n   - Sidebar optimization with live stats\n   - Status filter for feed (all/unread/starred/read/archived)\n   - Granular date filter with range picker\n   - Score/filter detail expander per article\n   - Editable settings page\n   - Editable filters with add/edit forms\n   - Restart app from settings page (pending at summary time)\n\n3. **Current session actions**:\n\n   a. **Restart button on settings page**: Added a restart section at the bottom of settings page with a button that spawns a new streamlit process and exits the current one via `os._exit(0)`.\n\n   b. **Add filter form hidden by default**: Made the \"Nouveau filtre\" button a toggle (not just set to True) and ensured form is hidden by default.\n\n   c. **User: \"aligne le filtre de date sur la même ligne que les autres filtres\"**: Moved the date range picker into the same row as search, status, and category filters. Changed from 4 columns to 5 columns layout `[2, 1.2, 1.2, 2, 0.4]`. Moved `today` variable outside the column blocks so it's accessible in the date range parsing code.\n\n   d. **User: \"pour le détail du calcul des scores fait un bouton aligner sur les autres (archiver, favoris, etc...)\"**: Replaced the old `st.expander` for score details with a 6th button column using `st.popover(\"📊\")` aligned with the other action buttons. Removed the standalone expander block.\n\n   e. **User: \"propose moi une todo list et une features list\"**: Explored the codebase thoroughly and proposed:\n      - **TODO List** (7 items): Reports not connected, Mastodon collector missing, Custom collector missing, Desktop notifications missing, Low test coverage, No auto-export, Double DB init\n      - **Features List** (16 items): Export CSV, Slack/Discord, Advanced search, Offline mode, Stats page, Manual collection, Import/Export config, Notes, Sharing, Cross-source dedup, NLP, Multi-users, REST API, Dark mode, PWA, RSS output\n\n   f. **User: \"fait toute la to do list et les points 3, 5, 6, 9 de la feature list\"**: \n      - Feature 3: Advanced full-text search with operators\n      - Feature 5: Functional statistics page with real data\n      - Feature 6: Manual collection from dashboard\n      - Feature 9: Article sharing via email/Telegram\n\n   Created 11 tasks and implemented all of them:\n\n   **Task 1 - Connect report generation in scheduler**: Replaced TODO/pass stubs in `_run_daily_report()` and `_run_weekly_report()` with actual calls to `generate_daily_report()` and `generate_weekly_report()` from reporting.generator.\n\n   **Task 2 - Mastodon collector**: Created `src/collectors/mastodon.py` with MastodonCollector class supporting hashtag, account, and timeline collection types via public Mastodon API.\n\n   **Task 3 - Custom collector**: Created `src/collectors/custom.py` with CustomCollector class supporting arbitrary JSON APIs with configurable field mapping, nested items_path, auth tokens, etc.\n\n   **Task 4 - Desktop notifications**: Created `src/alerting/desktop.py` with DesktopChannel class using `notify-send` on Linux. Updated `src/alerting/__init__.py` to register the desktop channel in `setup_channels()`.\n\n   **Task 5 - Tests**: Created 8 new test files covering web, reddit, youtube, mastodon, custom collectors, dedup, enricher, reporting generator, and desktop notifications.\n\n   **Task 6 - Auto-export reports**: Added `_send_report_notification()` method to scheduler that dispatches a notification via alert channels when reports are generated.\n\n   **Task 7 - Fix double DB initialization**: Added `_db_initialized` flag to `src/storage/database.py` so `init_database()` only runs once per process. Reset flag in `close_database()`.\n\n   **Task 8 - Advanced search**: Added `_parse_search_query()` function supporting AND, OR, NOT, -term, \"quoted phrases\". Updated search placeholder text.\n\n   **Task 9 - Stats page**: Enhanced `get_stats()` to return items_per_day, items_by_category, alerts_by_severity, top_keywords, health indicators, db_size. Rewrote `render_stats_page()` with comprehensive charts and metrics.\n\n   **Task 10 - Manual collection**: Added `run_collection_now()` async function. Added \"📥 Collecter tout\" global button and per-source \"📥\" collect button in the sources table.\n\n   **Task 11 - Article sharing**: Added `_share_via_telegram()` and `_share_via_email()` functions to feed.py. Added 7th button column with popover showing Telegram, Email, and copy options.\n\n   **Additional fixes**:\n   - Registered mastodon and custom collectors in `src/collectors/__init__.py`\n   - Added `custom` to source type dropdown in dashboard\n   - Added `READ = \"read\"` to `ItemStatus` enum (was missing, causing references to `ItemStatus.READ` to fail)\n   - Updated `src/alerting/__init__.py` to include desktop channel\n   - Verified all imports and syntax with Python compilation checks\n\nLet me now compile all the details accurately.\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1.

Parses status content, media attachments, engagement metrics\n     - Registered with `@register_collector` decorator\n\n   - **`/home/user/sentinelpi/src/collectors/custom.py`** - NEW FILE\n     - CustomCollector class for arbitrary JSON APIs\n     - Configurable: method, headers, auth_token, api_key, items_path, field mapping\n     - Supports nested JSON paths (e.g., \"data.articles\")\n     - Auto-generates GUID from content hash if not mapped\n     - Handles timestamps as ISO strings or Unix timestamps\n\n   - **`/home/user/sentinelpi/src/alerting/desktop.py`** - NEW FILE\n     - DesktopChannel class using `notify-send` (Linux/libnotify)\n     - Severity-to-urgency mapping (info→low, notice→normal, warning→normal, critical→critical)\n     - Checks for `notify-send` availability with `shutil.which()`\n     - Uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` for async execution\n\n   - **`/home/user/sentinelpi/src/alerting/__init__.py`** - Updated\n     - Added import of DesktopChannel and create_desktop_channel\n     - Added desktop channel registration in `setup_channels()`\n\n   - **`/home/user/sentinelpi/src/collectors/__init__.py`** - Updated\n     -

Updated\n     - Added `READ = \"read\"` to `ItemStatus` enum (was missing, causing runtime errors)\n\n   - **Test files created** (8 new files):\n     - `tests/test_collectors/test_web.py` - Web scraper collector tests\n     - `tests/test_collectors/test_reddit.py` - Reddit collector tests\n     - `tests/test_collectors/test_youtube.py` - YouTube collector tests (incl. channel ID extraction)\n     - `tests/test_collectors/test_mastodon.py` -

Errors and fixes:\n   - **ItemStatus.READ not in enum**: The dashboard code referenced `ItemStatus.READ` but the enum only had `SEEN`. Fixed by adding `READ = \"read\"` to the ItemStatus enum in models.py.\n   - **`today` variable scoping**: When moving the date filter into a column, `today` was defined inside the `with col4:` block but referenced later in the date range parsing code. Fixed by moving `today = date_type.today()` before the columns definition.\n   - **Redundant restart code**: Initial implementation had identical if/else branches for the restart button. Cleaned up to remove the redundancy.\n   - **New collectors not registered**: After creating mastodon.py and custom.py, they weren't importable via the collectors package. Fixed by adding imports to `src/collectors/__init__.py`.\n   - **Desktop channel not wired**: After creating desktop.py, it wasn't registered in the alerting system. Fixed by updating `src/alerting/__init__.py` to import and register the desktop channel.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - Bridged async SQLAlchemy with sync Streamlit via `run_async()` helper\n   - Manual collection implemented with inline deduplication by GUID check\n   - Advanced search parser handles complex query syntax (AND/OR/NOT/quotes) and converts to SQLAlchemy conditions\n   - Stats page now queries real data including per-day item counts, keyword frequency analysis from JSON fields, and source health indicators\n   - Article sharing reuses existing Telegram/Email channel infrastructure by constructing AlertPayload objects\n   - Report scheduling now connected end-to-end: scheduler → generator → file storage → notification dispatch\n\n6.
